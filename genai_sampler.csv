The physical labour abour were carried out (in almost all cases) by locals. (And they were Africans,,,, because we are talking about Africa.) This was due to the fact that tycoons and aristocracy from the west were in control of the economic and administrative bureaus in the colonies.

"I didn't understand your rant, but I agree corruption is a big issue in Africa (and in Asia, Russia and America) - but at the very least the govt that gives these concessions is elected and at least has some accountability to the people (however small). As for slavery (I am guessing you are AA)  the concept of ""black"" is a Victorian concept. Most African languages don't have the concept of black and white until the Portuguese hit the east African coastline in the 16th century.

"I am British. I agree that Britain and other Western governments are no better, or likely worse than Chinese. I also agree that this documentary is completely biased. However, regardless of nationality, the value of land to produce food, clean water to support human population, and productive forests which provide raw materials will always be worth more than gold. Only after the soil has been destroyed. Only after the last river has been poisoned. Only after the last fish has been caught. Only then will you find that gold cannot be eaten. So stop arguing about who is to blame for what. We are all citizens of planet earth. And we all depend on each other to help one another and do what is right. Forget the gold.

That would mean that no visas would be issued to Ghanaians to China and her allies if the applicant is not working for an Asian company. The Chinese won't lose anything from that but Ghanaians would suffer for it cos they would have to deport all Ghanaians in China who do not work for Asian companies too. Plus China gives us aid and loans and scholarships and most of our medical equipment and electronics come from there. If they decided to stop trading here this country would collapse.

"Devolved government may help this situation, meaning every region should have their own elected governor or elected DCE’s so that those people are directly accountable to their immediate people. Winner takes all government is dangerous because if 8 years they get they need to accumulate enough to last them the next 8 years but if they know that opposition is also going to give them some income all politicians, chief executives, DCE’s and the rest may behave well. Here in UK this kind of problem will be under council and if it gets worse that’s when central government comes in. The council collects local taxes and sends you periodic breakdown of what your taxes are used for that how much local police gets and bin collectors etc. The point is the council is voted by only local residents. If I have problems I don’t go to the prime minister at least until I know the council cannot handle my issues.

It's very clear that Ghana's Gift Policy under the National Anti Corruption Action Plan (NACAP) makes it compulsory for public office holders and public servants to hand over gifts received to their heads of institutions.  Heads of institutions will take the final decision on the disposal of the gift.  Public servants are required to sign and make a gift statement every quarter under the Ghana Gift Policy.  Copies of the gift statement are to be signed and handed over to institution heads who will forward them to  the CHRAJ.

I disagree with Magraheb on some of his points in this video. I believe that any form of gifts received by any government official or any other individual has the potential to influence what that person does going forward. The receiver of that gift can develop a soft spot for the giver and that’s the whole premise of bribery.

One is entitled to give an opinion but when you do have the knowledge or not privy to certain information he shouldn't condemn anything.  somebody should tell him to go learn about what corruption is.,Ugx_fLwY6rF7C6mPUUp4AaABAg,3,0,2019-03-18T14:38:12Z,,KjCXaFHfx9E,ANAS latest Galamsay Exposé Explained || Pae Mu Ka (Magraheb TV),Magraheb TV,3/4/2019 18:51,106011,1724,401
"Bribe is defined as, dishonestly persuade (someone) to act in one's favour by a gift of money or other inducement. One doesn't need to request for money before it is termed bribery,  whether money received before or after information given is still BRIBE depending on the subject matter and motives of parties involved. Please don't forget that all these guys involved in taking monies are there to stop illegal mining. And the meeting between Tiger and Bissiu, clearly Mr. Bissiu is not aware of the machines taken to the sight, but then, the big question is, is he there to help fast track processing of documents of illegal miners or stop them from mining.

You are making a lot of excuses for the money exchange. You have to ask yourself what context was the money exchanged? Everyone who took money is meant to protect the country in the office they hold. Even if you accept a gift after doing a clean job it is still against your duty of call. As a nurse it’s against my profession to accept gift from a patient that I have looked after.

"Bro, there is something called  code of conduct. Code of Conduct highlights, reasonable behavior and conduct in relation to giving what we call gifts & favors, kickback, confidential information, conflict of interest, control and use of assets and information, inside trading, political contribution and etc. The idea of code of conduct is to ascertain that no employee, member of an organization or government doesn't compromise themselves in any interaction, communication or dealings at any point in time of their association to an entity during or after their their association with that institution. I think corporations in Ghana have literally thrown out the above practice and perhaps many are aware yet don't heed to the statues and remifications of the same. So those who are aware and heed to such policies know that they cannot accept any amount of money in the name of tip/thank you, gift or favor from any one during, before or after office hours in the face of dealings that has to do with an organization that the officer, personnel or person is employed by. It's quite a simple policy but our culture disregards it. The ramifications is really unsustainable corporations. There are no jobs because certain individuals are making their own corner deals which shutters and negates their employer from thousands and in some cases millions of income.",Ugzvo2d2Okdnj_UQZYV4AaABAg,0,0,2019-03-11T20:20:47Z,,KjCXaFHfx9E,ANAS latest Galamsay Exposé Explained || Pae Mu Ka (Magraheb TV),Magraheb TV,3/4/2019 18:51,106011,1724,401

"Well I agree with you to some point, but I believe the issue here is not necessarily an official demanding money before doing something for them.

I have notice in Ghana especially in the banking sector that, taking gifts has become something enjoyable and that it has become a normal way of life which in a way is not right.

"Magraheb, I have been following your videos and really enjoy your analysis. These among others are the reason why you are not supposed to collect any form of gift in your line of duty. Here in the UK most of the institutions will only accept “thank u” as the best form of gift or a card or if it’s candies, it will be placed at the reception for all the team members to enjoy. In the above scenario, no one can be entrapped. Accepting money for just offering information at a front desk is highly illegal in the western world. It has landed presidents in trouble. Come to think of it did Mr Bissiw declare that monetary gift he accepted? I am really sad because these kind of behaviour really compromise and expose our presidency. I am not just comfortable with the way and manner money is used as the main tool for entrapment on Gh. This is pure greed. That is why FIFA found Sepp Blatter, Nyantakyi and others guilty.

"I must congratulate you on how you have added another dimension to your arsenal but analyzing topical issues albeit with your dose of humour and comedy. You also never fail to pick on your man Capito lol. Good analyzes but think you went off a bit around the gift issue. Your opinion was well and seem very frank. However, on the bribery issue you make a mistake which most Gh people make because of the cultural orientation that leads to bribery (the culture of gift giving/demands unnecessarily as a show of appreciation) and the other underdeveloped structures in the country. The structures and systems are bad and slow so they frustrate people and so people show gratitude when somehow helps out albeit that they are doing their work. This is unethical and borders on bribery. If you live in Europe and you apply for a job no matter the number of applicants etc no appreciation gift is demanded or accepted. Till we LEARN that as Gh people, even if the person volunteers the amount without our asking etc,  we will NEVER have a handle on corruption BAM!!!!!

"Sometimes you try really hard to appear neutral and that masks the truth. Tell me where else in the developed world a government or civic official accepts cash gifts to perform their role or in this case ""expedite processes""? The police, government officials, and crooks with access to government official (this should tell you everything about the government official who stepped down after he got caught) should not accept cash ""gifts"" to do their jobs? It is never a gift accepting money that will influence decisions to bypass bureaucracies. In your video you keep saying you yourself will take monies offered because of a meager salary but this is (speaks volumes of something called integrity and the lack thereof) the root of bribery when even through expose' you still condoning and rationalizing corruption. I know you do satiric sketches but u need to realise you have a platform and an opportunity to change the narrative. People in government sectors, positions of power with ability to influence decisions should really reconsider taking monies in form of gifts because its flat out wrong and should be condemned. If people wana accept tips then they should take bar tending or waiter jobs because thats an institution based on money for service.",Ugz6vdE1US9uuobNExh4AaABAg,0,0,2019-03-05T04:07:27Z,,KjCXaFHfx9E,ANAS latest Galamsay Exposé Explained || Pae Mu Ka (Magraheb TV),Magraheb TV,3/4/2019 18:51,106011,1724,401

"I do like your videos and how you use comedy sometimes to bring light to current issues. On this video, some of your explanations seems to be a bit off. Which is why it is causing some confusion among your followers as to whether taking money as gift was bribery or not. I suppose you should have defined what bribery is or what constitutes bribery in a government setting first before following up with you opinions/explanations on the subject. According to wex law dictionary this is what Bribery means..""Bribery refers to the offering, giving, soliciting, or receiving of any item of value as a means of influencing the actions of an individual holding a public or legal duty. ... Solicitation of a bribe also constitutes a crime and is completed regardless of whether the solicitation results in the receipt of a valuable gift. In other words Magraheb, some of your explanations are not right and I think you owe it to your faithful viewers to come back with a right explanations on this subject.

"#STOP-THE-GALAMSEY-NOW. Are we worthy of nature’s gift of minerals? If we need the Gold, why not the government mining it and selling it to these Chinese and the World at large? We know the harm Surface Mining does to the forest, our water bodies and the ecology with the participation of weak private companies whose sole aim is prospecting for gold. These weak companies careless when they destroy the rivers by using it for washing the gold. In fact, almost invariably, they divert the river to concentrate it into their dugout ponds. The code of conduct for Surface Mining includes reclaiming the land by levelling the already mined area by backfiling it and replanting the tree to regrow the forest which could take another 10-15 years to achieve. This exercise is so strenuous that only  well-structured companies have the time and resources to accomplish. Just allowing people with African mentally to mine our forest is unhelpful and dangerous. We Africans don't care about the consequences of the devastation of the forest, rivers and the landscape and the consequences of the eminent errosion that will follow. If we cannot control the immediate harm Surface Mining brings, let's leave the gold in the soil and do our traditional farming on the land up until some sensible crop of Ghanaians come with a good plan to start mining the gold. Gold could be a gift and a curse in the same breath. Stop galamsey all over. Even when we will allow Surface mining, the distance between concessions should be not less than 10Km from each other and two concessions in every 30Km stretch. The rules should be stringent and tight to avoid negative impact on our environment. Such activity requires regular inspection by the government. Each Operation Site should be equipped with at least two water tankers. You see now, none of the sites we found escavators working there had Water Tankers, meaning, the rivers serving the communities nearby are used directly by the miners to wash their gold TOO BAD!!!!. In all things, put Ghana first, Mahama and Nana Addo, this is your call. I hate when a party wins power, they sacrifice our safety on the Altar of distributing our natural resources to party supporters and family. Look, if America, the UK, Germany, Russia, France, Japa, Korea moved along our lines, they would by now be extinct. Instead, they have grown from strength to strength. Anytime, I hear developed countries insulting Africans. Our Leaders are not there for the preservation of our people and the land. My Canadian Boss told me if he came to Africa to think and work  like Africans, he would also be poor like Africans. A word to the wise is enough. Ghana and Korea and Malaysia had indelendence about the same time, they dint have the resouces we have but look at the difference. I want to see selfless leaders who will come and improve our lot but not to sell off our resources to enrich himself and party faithfuls. Now, let's change leadership qualification for Ghana. At every party's congress, the presidential candidate should be assembled and be interviewed by a panel of Journalists and professionals organised by the EC and the best 3 candidates should go for election at the Congress. That way, the best candidate could emerge. No screening, no voting.",UgyzclDFOgqWr0t0Yi14AaABAg,1,0,2021-05-24T11:35:34Z,,ObQNoK2QNGw,Live: Illegal Mining Updates on Phase 3 of Operation Halt - News Desk on JoyNews (19-5-21),JoyNews,5/20/2021 16:15,92569,414,224

"Mr. President, please, as a matter of urgency, declare a state of Emergency on  all the mining areas. I know for a fact that all the approved mining companies are doing surface mining and only in Obuasi I saw an underground mining by Anglogold. I built communication links everywhere for Ashanti Goldfield, Amansie Resources, in Amansie off Bekwai, Teberebe in Tarkwa, Goldfield Ghana in Abosso in Daman, AGL in Bibiani, Ayanfuri,  Sansu and I think most of those sites were surface mining. For Amansie Resources, I saw them replanting the trees they destroyed. The had dug out Ponds for washing the gold. Also, if Escavators are found lined up along the road especially where there is no road construction activity going on. The Operation Teams should question their purposes for any parked Escavators being where they are parked. Such Escavators may have been removed hurriedly from the mine sites for fear of being burnt. This Operation should be equipped with night overhead patrol capability using helicopters to find the Galamsey miners by night. Our Lands and Rivers and Forests are under attack. Know that, we migrated from the Old Ghana Empire  to the present day Ghana due poor water sources, bad land and war. If we obliterate these mainstays, where will we go to settle in this era of defined territorial boundaries documented and recognized by the United Nations?

"Lol.. I understand the outburst of emotions but let's not talk about prayers because most people don't know what prayers are or what to expect when they pray, that's why it's not working. Prayer will not work if not backed by corresponding action. The root question we should be asking is why? Why are these people doing what they're doing? I once asked someone who had a galamsey site how much gold they expect to get from that site? According to the person, they were not even expecting to get up to a cup of gold after digging and destroying the land. So why are they doing it? They don't know what else to do,  for most people. Skill acquisition and creating systems of employment including an enabling environment for entrepreneurs is what we need. Let's focus on sustainable and meaningful development and not what had been sold to us as development. E.g. Instead of destroying that sane land for let's assume 1 cup of gold which we'll sell of and spend in max. a few years, we can plant and process foods which will be a sustainable industry for several years.",UgwqTC0X4n8gGhSC8w94AaABAg,0,0,2022-11-01T18:11:24Z,,RmYyIX8coXs,"Men Of G0d Chant At Galamsey Site In Ghana, Social Media People Veeeexxxxxxx!!!",Kwadwo Sheldon Studios,10/17/2022 18:25,24227,1249,266

"I can comfortably outline why things have gotten to this point and how it is almost impossible to stop this menace....bros it's more than just people wanting to destroy lands and water bodies....the very basis of our minerals and mining laws are a scam itself... Right from when the white man drafted the first constitution till now...we have been living a delusion for decades and we hate the real truth be told. Like I have been saying ..Cocoa farming is a scam and until cocoa farmers see a change in their lives forget it neo-galamsey isn't stopping...many farmers now see value selling off some of their lands than working them like slaves.. sending the police and military taskforce is just creating a false avenue for them to enrich themselves....there are areas where miners re informed of operations before it's done... zero presence on site by the time task forces get on site...until the rural communities see a change in their local economies and poverty reduces forget it cuz no government can fight this without the cooperation of the galamsey communities themselves. We have ignored and relegated these communities for too long..An agricultural country whose middle class and elite look down on Agric , what do you expect? No substantial investments etc .. we had rather pursue engineering courses with a absolutely no job market here than expand Agric studies which has enough opportunities here all in the name of some freaking prestige..We seldom are pragmatic. Ssme colonial era stance... our educate populace are clueless and for our leaders only God knoweth. A common graduate lingering around the offices of cocoaboard earns more in a month than what some cocoa farmers with over 10acres of cocoa earn in a year yet these same white collar workers will clutch and hijack every opportunity in a cocoa scholarship scheme whilst wards of cocoa farmers are left at the mercy of less education..where is the cocoa board head office situated? In a non cocoa growing region. ....infact a gold nugget the size of a cocoa bean is worth more than several sacks of cocoa....who doesn't want money or we in the big cities think we re the only ones that deserve the good life and looting and scheming around the national cake? What we re seeing with galamsey is not just a menace but the reward for our fullness, indifference, non patriotism, greed, inequity, indecisions and ill orientation.

The oppostion together with some NPP MP’s drafted a bill to criminalize same sex act. Something that is already illegal in the country.

We prefer to spend millions of dollars on building a cathedral whiles our major hospitals in the country lacks beds, roofs are leaking, pregnant women are sleeping on the floor in maternity wards.

"Do they think that they deserve praise? Now that the waters are destroyed what’s the benefit of the operation; to stop further destruction? It doesn’t make sense at this moment. What was the Environmental Protection Agency(EPA) doing when “galamsey” started? What was the sense in burning the excavators? Couldn’t it be used by the metropolitan assemblies? Total senseless! Africans, we always wait for things to destroy before we take action. People kill animals anyhow. We destroy natural resources anyhow. I’m waiting for the day that animals, trees, the waters, the air etc go on serious demonstration. If there’s any department that is to preserve the wildlife then they should begin action for we are shorting some animals and birds. When was the last time you saw vultures( you call them witches?

"This is appalling Ghana, using Ghanaian soldiers to protect Chinese illegal miners. Ghana always made us believe that it needs money to build the country and they would go all over the world to borrow money at high interest rates and yet still they got Chinese people here to destroy our precious forests and ecology and looted all our wealth.  What is the sense in all these?. Somebody tells me. I know all these forest devastation by the Chinese started when NDC was in power.  I  also heard that the soldiers NANA AKUFO-ADDO sent to combat illegal miners has themselves turned to illegal mining. It was apparently in the recent election that who was illegal mining champion Mahama or Nana. While Nana and his magnificent NPP party were telling the voters to stop illegal mining. Mahama and his destroyer party NDC were doing the opposite telling the illegal miners to continue with their business as usual in order to win them over. I  heard Mahama promising the voters that when he come to power again he would allow illegal mining to go on . So now don't tell me Nana is entirely responsible for these despicable acts. For the reader who said that Papa J would have stopped this despicable act, I say papa was the one who started all these in his administration. He once said to the world that Ghana still has a lot of natural resources and they are free for the taken. For Mahama and his NDC party l say being in the opposition, doesn't mean that you have to criticise everything NPP propose to do or do just to score political points over them. If it is in the interest of the country please come into concerns with the government. For the soldiers who are involving in these illicit trade , they should stop right now.  The Chinese are only using them, they exploiting the whole Africa countries to build their country and raise  their citizens from poverty.",UgzsokPlhAFxsP9MzRN4AaABAg,1,2,2021-01-20T08:00:58Z,,mhEVWkopRBU,Over 30 fully-armed military protecting miners pillaging Manso Forest -  JoyNews Prime (18-1-21),JoyNews,1/18/2021 22:18,141707,1044,401

What happened to the bullion, the gold concentrate, the dollars, pounds, euro, yuan, cedis, the mercury and all the likes?? Well that's the big money...so those figures, we shall never know. Those in charge have become millionaires in a matter of days, cus they under declared, or never declared what was seized. As for the Tundras and Tacomas they have been parked in people's garages in Accra. These should have been sold, and together with the hard cash, used to reclaim the land and restore the forest. Send crack soldiers down there, let miners together with the Chinese use the excavators to reclaim the land, back fill and spend time replanting. We can only weep for our nation, things would not change, don't forget the next group of greedy bastards are being bred and undergoing training as PA to many of our big men",Ugyf_xWgghGuQz9Nhz94AaABAg,8,1,2021-01-20T00:12:14Z,,mhEVWkopRBU,Over 30 fully-armed military protecting miners pillaging Manso Forest -  JoyNews Prime (18-1-21),JoyNews,1/18/2021 22:18,141707,1044,401

The days of America and all its allies are numbered and the stone which was cast way back against its regime is very close. It will crush it and all others until there is nothing left to hold on to.",UgwNK9qeO7leP_nXWOp4AaABAg,0,0,2024-09-08T08:19:22Z,,nCR9LrWz79M,Ghana Galamsey now reaches Sea?

If government officials and ordinary citizens refrain from corruption for a number of years and even forever our country Ghana will move forward in terms of development and even healthcare. Unfortunately there are way too much blood sucking vampires who have no genuine love for the country. They are only thinking about the present cash and not investing in massive infrastructures that will last the country for many years. Look at how they think. They will give a piece of land to a yellow friend to ruin it for a few dollars without thinking about the effects for the next generation.  I even heard a friend telling me that some yellow  people in Asia sees Africans as dumb because they are able to do anything in Africa as long they give Africans food. Have we become so weak that even our fellow yellow people look down on us? We have to change and become strong. Try going to any part of the east or west and dig the ground for gold.

Some parts of Africa have been so impoverished nd neglected for so long that they love the Chinese for giving them a little food and money. One document I watched showed a Chinese man bragging about how well they treated the Africans who illegally mined for them. Paying the miners 2x as much as they usually made($140/mnth). They gave them plastic tents to live in and gave them a little food ever day. Desperation has driven Africans into the arms of these people.

That is a lie they are not their to discover the gold they are their to steal it if they are illegally doing so as you mentioned it. The lie that Africa doesn't know how to use the land is a lie you even mentioned it was a farm land to feed Africa... They just exploited the land. If someone breaks into your yard and starts digging holes and you fall into one of those holes and get hurt is it your fault or the intruder who entered your gates and dug holes? Indeed it is the intruder and they should pay damages for your injuries and fees to repair the land as well as fees for the stolen gold plus interest as punishment and possibly jail time depending on amount stolen. I highly advise more media outlets like yours in Africa to report of this information. I read of China being somewhat harsh to Africans in China specifically Ugandians because of crimes some of them may have committed... to the point where innocent people were not allowed to book hotels, not able to eat at restaurants and so on.... should Ghana start halting passport acceptance for Chinese until this issue is resolve of theft of Gold? Should all of Africa stop all Chinese building infrastructure projects until the corruption stops?

"Seems like a regulation problem that these lands are available in the first place for mining operations if there were (or were supposed to be) functioning farmlands there ahead of time. Perhaps it's not the government of Ghana's fault originally if the regulations were already in place but now that the effects are being seen it should certainly be looked at.
Whether it's better for the mining operations to be driven out or whether the money they bring to the region is better for development in the long run is something the government needs to decide.

I am taking my money over there. I already made my decision no joke. Once I get the opportunity I am going to give back to the people. My people. You go over to China guess what. No foreigner can buy land over there. Even if you are a man married to a Chinese woman the property is in her name. They are racist as hell and only care about their people. As should all Africans care only about their people. No African businesses would not be allowed to buy an inch of land in China. I know the truth. Not dissing Wode Maya but if everyone has this soft attitude then guess what happens. There is a video on youtube not sure what African country but some Chinese own a restaurant and kick all Africans out after 5pm and only Chinese can eat there. Straight racism. In their own African country Chinese people regulating who can come in their food place. Instead of the people not eating there they still support it yet complain. Shaka Zulu would be ashamed if he was alive today how some Africans are soft. I am African American and this angers me. Mark my words I just watched a video about Chinese in Angola bringing business and only hiring their people and destroying homes of the poor Angola people. The Angola government selling out their own people not allowing them to build the hotels for the Chinese but guess what the politicians said all the money goes back to China. It doesn't help the Angola economy. They also have 60 thousand Chinese moving there. This post is not a joke. You can smile all you want Wode but you will be crying like the poor people who now are homeless in Angola because the Chinese destroyed their homes and put up expensive condos but they can't afford it because no jobs. African people need be like the Chinese or the Arabs in Saudi and say nope you can't buy any land here.
